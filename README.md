I recently completed a data analysis project for a bike store, leveraging SQL for data cleaning and extraction, and Power BI for visualization. Here's a snapshot of key insights from the storeâ€™s sales data over a three-year period (2016â€“2018):

ðŸ”¹ Total Orders: 4,722
ðŸ”¹ Customers: 1,444
ðŸ”¹ Total Sales Revenue: $7.69M
ðŸ”¹ Average Monthly Revenue: $640.76K

Key Takeaways:

Top-Performing Location: The New York, Baldwin bikes store leads with $5.2M in sales.

Top Brand: Trek tops the charts with $4.6M in revenue.

Highest Revenue Month: April, bringing in $1.21M.

Best-Selling Product Category: Mountain Bikes, contributing to 35.31% of total sales.


This dashboard delivers valuable insights into store performance, brand success, revenue patterns, and product trends. Such analyses empower bike store owners and managers to make data-driven decisions and optimize their business strategy.
